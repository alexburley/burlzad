# Tests live next to the code

Tests should live next to the code they are testing. This makes it easier to find and maintain tests. This includes test data, and mocking/stubbing functions related to tests. Keep that in a `test` folder adjacent to the src code folder.

Modern test frameworks make it easy to ignore.
